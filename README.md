## TF Binding Relationship Between Level of Expression

Transcription factors (TFs) are proteins that bind to DNA. They bind to the promoter regions of genes on DNA and activate (or sometimes repress) the expression of the gene.
A researcher collected data (**TFbindings.txt**) on the binding level of several TFs (Nanog, Oct4...) at the promoters of genes (Gene1, Gene2...) and the expression level of the genes.
The researcher believes that there is a linear relationship between the level of TF binding and the level of expression, and in this study a linear model is created to test this hypothesis.
